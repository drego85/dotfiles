# This very small script is used to control VLC from the command line.
# First, set up VLC. Enable RC interface and Fake-TTY, then set the UNIX socket.
# For example my socket is located at /tmp/vlc.sock. This socket is created
# every time you open VLC.
#
# Now you can send command to VLC. You can se all available command with
# 'vlc -I rc' and 'help' or 'longhelp' commands.
#
# The output of commands is printed to stdout, it can be useful.
#
# Some examples:
#   * Pause/Play the current stream: vlc-player-control pause
#   * Enqueue a track in the current playlit: vlc-player-control enqueue path
#   * Play the next track in the playlist: vlc-player-control next

VLC=/tmp/vlc.sock

# $@ are all commands line arguments, except the script name.
