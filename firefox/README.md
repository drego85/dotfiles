# Firefox dotfiles

This folder contains all files used to customize my Firefox experience.

## Extentions

Extentions can't be installed from command line, so you need to install them
manually (or use [Firefox Sync][0]). I use these extentions:

* **CanvasBlocker**: prevent Canvas fingerprinting; [FA][1] [Sources][2]
* **CSS Exfil Protection**: prevent CSS Exfil attacks; [FA][3] [Source][4]
* **Decentraleyes**: local emulation of CDN; [FA][5] [Source][6]
* **HTTPS Everywhere**: force HTTPS on sites; [FA][7] [Source][8]
* **Tridactyl**: VIM keybindings on Firefox; [FA][9] [Source][10]
* **uBlock Origin**: general blocker; [FA][11] [Source][12]

All these extentions are automatically updated via Firefox, so you only need to
download them the first time.
