== What they are

This repository contains some dotfiles, scripts and configurations that I use
every day.

== Requirements

My dotfiles are distro-agnostic, but `dotfiles` script is written specifically
to work with **Fedora**. Custom scripts under `bin` are written to work with any
computer with Bash, also the configuration files of several programs.

== Installation

=== Dotfiles installation

My dotfiles are organized as modules. Every module is a small Bash script that
can do many things, usually they:

* Install software (via `dnf`);
* Install configuration files;
* Activate something (like services).

For a list of available modules run `dotfiles list`. Some modules have a
reserved folder, which contains specific configuration files.

=== Repository installation

You can directly download this repository and run the `dotfiles` script:

    $ git clone git@gitlab.com:ema-pe/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles

Or, if you don't have SSH keys installed:

----
$ git clone https://gitlab.com/ema-pe/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
$ cd ~/.dotfiles
$ ./dotfiles install gpg git
$ # install gpg keys...
$ git remote set-url origin git@gitlab.com:ema-pe/dotfiles.git
----

If you want to update git submodule to last commit, run this command:

    git submodule foreach git pull origin master

If there are new commits, you also need to commit this update.

== Modules

=== bash

These modules simply link my bash configuration, that consists of a `bashrc` and
`bash_profile` file. It contains essential environment variables, aliases and
small scripts.

It also provides some autocompletion scripts for `dotfiles` script and other
cusotm scripts.

'''

=== bin

This module install all scripts in link:bin[`bin`] directory to `~/.local/bin`.
These scripts are written in various programming languages (Python, Bash) and
they can require special software or libraries to run. Always read the entire
script before use!

Available scripts:

* link:bin/aenami[*aenami*]: a small Python script that downloads the lastest
Alena Aenami's artwork from ArtStation.
* link:bin/backup[*backup*]: this script syncs some data from my laptop to my
external HDD.
* link:bin/firefox-tmp[*firefox-tmp*]: this script launches a temporary Mozilla
Firefox instance (useful for testing or debugging).
* link:bin/gandi-aliases[*gandi-aliases*]: this script manages aliases for my
email hosted on https://www.gandi.net/en[Gandi.net].
* link:bin/goodmorningitalia[*goodmorningitalia*]: this script automatically
subscribe a 30-days free trial on
https://app.goodmorningitalia.it/[*goodmorningitalia.it*], an Italian
newsletter.
* link:bin/ho[*ho*]: this script prints several information about an Ho Mobile
(an italian low cost MVNO) account to the standard output.
* link:bin/musicconvert[*musicconvert*]: this script syncs my music library to a
destinarion directory, copying all files except for FLAC files, that are
converted to OGG using `ffmpeg`. The reason of this script is that my mobile
phone has a limited space.
* link:bin/osmgpx[*osmgpx*]: this script filters and uploads a list of GPX
files.
* link:bin/screen-off[*screen-off*]: this simple script turns off the screen.
* link:bin/adoc2latex[*adoc2latex*]: a small GAWK script that converts an
Asciidoc file to LaTeX.
* link:bin/odt2adoc[*odt2adoc*]: a small Python script that extracts text from
an OpenDocument file to a pure text file.

'''

=== vim

I use VIM as my text editor for programming and writing. I found it very
productive and efficient.

My link:vim/vimrc[vimrc] file is well documented, I also use some plugins:

* https://github.com/junegunn/goyo.vim[*goyo.vim*]: for writing without
distractions.
* https://github.com/NLKNguyen/papercolor-theme[*papercolor-theme*]: a VIM color
scheme inspired by Google's Material Design.
* https://github.com/hdima/python-syntax[*python-syntax*]: better Python syntax
highlighting.
* https://github.com/reedes/vim-pencil[*vim-pencil*]: better movements for
writing prose.
* https://github.com/justinmk/vim-syntax-extra[*vim-syntax-extra*]: better C
syntax highlighting.
* https://github.com/tmhedberg/SimpylFold[*SimplylFold*]: better Python folding.
* https://git.zx2c4.com/password-store/tree/contrib/vim[*redact_pass*]: improve
security when editing a password file with VIM. It requires `pass` package.
* https://github.com/habamax/vim-asciidoctor[*vim-asciidoctor*]: better Asciidoc
syntax highlighting and also support for folding.

Both *goyo.vim* and *vim-pencil* are not automatically started with VIM, instead
you need to run `vim -c Writing`.

'''

=== focuswriter

link:https://gottcode.org/focuswriter[FocusWriter] is a simple, distraction free
text editor. I use it to write short stories and novels, with a custom theme and
configuration.

This modules will install `focuswriter`, and copy my configuration and custom
theme.

WARNING: My custom theme and configuration have my username hard-coded!

'''

=== tlp

TLP is a useful package to manage power and extends battery life. It works well
with other power management software (like `xfce4-powermanager`).

This package can be found via Fedora official repository with the name `tlp`.

The default configuration file, located on `/etc/default/tlp` is good, but I've
done some customization (I'm using a Thinkpad laptop).

The basic commands available are:

* Start tlp: `sudo tlp start` (but there is also a unit file for systemd);
* Check the configuration: `sudo tlp stat`;
* Manage Wi-Fi and Bluetooth: `wifi [on/off]` and `bluetooth [on/off]`.

This module will install tlp, copy my configuration, start tlp and enable the
unit file (for systemd).

'''

=== dotfiles

This module installs the `dotfiles` script to `~/.local/bin` folder. It is
supposed that this path is added previously to `PATH` environment variable.

'''

=== clean

This module simply removes via `dnf` all pre-installed Fedora packaged that I
don't use. For a list of these packages, open the script and go to the `clean`
module.

'''

=== gpg

I use GnuPG to manager my PGP keys. GnuPG have also an agent called
`gpg-agent`, I use it also for SSH support. There is some configuration because
out-of-the-box Fedora uses `ssh-agent` and `gnome-keyring`.

The GnuPG file configuration is located at `~/.gnupg/gpg.conf`, the agent
configuration is located at `~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf`. This module installs
them.

There is a default daemon enabled of `gpg-agent`, but I prefer to manage the
daemon with `systemd --user`. Luckily GnuPG comes with default files for
systemd, but they are not enabled. This module enables them.

The module also enables `gpg-agent` for SSH support. It is necessary to
specify the environment variable `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` to point to `gpg-agent`
socket. This line is already added in my custom `.bashrc` file:

    export SSH_AUTH_SOCK="/run/user/$(id -u)/gnupg/S.gpg-agent.ssh"

I use Xfce as desktop environment. There is only one problem: it auto starts
`ssh-agent`. I don't want it, so I kill it every time Xfce is started. This
line is already added in my custom `.bash_profile` file:

    pkill ssh-agent

This module also installs `pinentry-gtk`, because I don't like the default
installed that uses ncurses.

'''

=== lightdm

https://github.com/canonical/lightdm[LightDM] is a desktop manager easy to use,
flexible and lightweight. I use it simply because it is pre-installed on Fedora.

I prefer an auto login method because the disk is encrypted and the computer
have only one user. I do not want to type two password when I boot the computer,
and the second is useless because if someone find the disk password he can grab
the data without problems. A display manager is also useless in my case because
I have only one user, but I keep it to have a "modern" desktop.

IMPORTANT: **DO NOT LOCK THE SCREEN**. If you lock the screen and go back to the
greeter, it crashes. I don't know why.

'''

=== xfce4

This module installs my configuration of Xfce desktop enviroment. Not all Xfce4
modules are configured via dotfiles, because is not easy (they don't have a
plain text configuration file, instead they use `xfconf`). The supported
applications are:

* link:xfce4/xfce4-panel/config.txt[*xfce4-panel*]: my panel configuration;
* link:xfce4/xfce4-terminal/[*xfce4-terminal*]: my terminal configuration.

'''

=== thunar

This module installs, via `xfconf-query`, my Thunar configuration. Note that if
you change the configuration via Thunar GUI, the new configuration will not be
synched to dotfiles. You need to manually update the configuration!

'''

=== xfwm4

I use Thinble Xfwm theme. In my repository under link:xfwm4[xfwm4] diretory you
can find the theme, but the original project is hosted on
link:https://paldepind.deviantart.com/art/Thinble-362276066[DevianArt]. The
following text is copied from DevianArt.

Thinble is a Xfwm theme with no title bar and a thin border. It was created to
be a good looking, simple and space efficient window theme for people who mainly
manage their windows using key bindings.

==== Features

* Minimal and space efficient appearance;
* No large title bar that is otherwise mostly just wasting space;
* Border of a reasonable size for moving/resizing windows using the mouse;
* Slightly darker border on active windows for distinguishing between them an
  inactive windows;
* Uses colors from your GTK-theme.

==== Installation

Copy link:xfwm4/thinble[`xfwm4/thinble`] directory to `~/.themes` for local
installation or to `/usr/share/themes` for system-wide installation. Or better
use my installer script!

IMPORTANT: Make the title font very large, otherwise you might still be able to
see the top of it in what is left of the title bar which does not look nice at
all.

'''

=== firefox

I use Mozilla Firefox as my main browser. I like it because is privacy focused,
fast and work really well in Linux. It is a big and complex software, it is not
easy to customize it.

==== Manual installation process

Unfortunately Firefox needs to be customized from GUI instead on CLI, so there
is not a real installer script. The steps to take are:

. Open a new terminal window and run this command: `firefox --ProfileManager`.
. Create a new user with this name: `default-release`.
. Login to Firefox Sync (or download all extensions you want).
. Customize Firefox GUI.
. To set custom `user.js`, run my installer script.

IMPORTANT: You need to create the default profile before run `dotfiles` script!

==== Extensions

Extensions can't be installed from command line, so you need to install them
manually (or use https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/features/sync/[Firefox
Sync]). I use these extensions:

* https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/canvasblocker/[*CanvasBlocker*]:
prevent Canvas fingerprinting;
* https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/css-exfil-protection/[*CSS Exfil Protection*]:
prevent CSS Exfil attacks;
* https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/decentraleyes/[*Decentraleyes*]:
local emulation of CDN;
* https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/https-everywhere/[*HTTPS Everywhere*]:
force HTTPS on sites;
* https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/https-everywhere/[*Tridactyl*]:
VIM keybindings on Firefox;
* https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/[*uBlock Origin*]:
general AD blocker;
* https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/neat-url/[*Neat URL*]:
remove garbage from URLs;
* https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/containerise/[*Containerise*]:
automatically open websites in a container;
* https://github.com/evilpie/add-custom-search-engine[*Add custom search engine*]:
add custom search engine.

All these extensions are automatically updated via Firefox, so you only need to
download them the first time.

==== Custom user.js

The `user.js` file is a file with all options to customize Firefox behavior.
Many options can be selected from the graphical interface, but lots are hidden.

I use https://github.com/ghacksuserjs/ghacks-user.js[ghacks' `user.js`], an
`user.js` enhanced for privacy. I don't like some options, so I have also a
custom link:firefox/user.js[`user.js`] that overrides some options.

This module will download the latest version of ghacks' `user.js` and move that
file to the Firefox profile with suffix `default-release`. At the end it appends
my custom options to `user.js` file on the profile.

== Makefile

I also provide a custom link:Makefile[Makefile] file to lint all scripts in my
repository. You need some special software, such as `shellcheck` to lint Bash
script or `flake8` to lint Python scripts.

This Makefile is executed on Gitlab CI, to run locally type `make all`. You can
also specify with file to lint, with `make` + `TAB`.

== License

Every script is licensed under the link:LICENSE[MIT License].
