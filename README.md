ema-pe dotfiles
===============

What they are
-------------

This repository contains some dotfiles, scripts and configurations that I use
everyday.

Requirements
------------

Configuration and dotfiles are distro-agnostic, but some commands are not. I
usually Fedora, so they will work on my distro, but on others might not.

Install
-------

Every folder is a module, which contains the configuration for that module.
There are some module only written in `dotfiles` script, because they have no
configuration (for example `gtk` only enable GTK+ theme).

Modules
