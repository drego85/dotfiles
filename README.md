ema-pe dotfiles
===============

What they are
-------------

This repository contains some dotfiles, scripts and configurations that I use
everyday.

Requirements
------------

Configuration and dotfiles are distro-agnostic, but some commands are not. I
usually Fedora, so they will work on my distro, but on others might not.

Install
-------

Every folder is a category. In each folder there is an installer script written
in Bash, that uses my custom library contained in `.commons`. You can run these
installer script to install the configuration and script of the category.

For more information you can read specific READMEs for every category.

License
-------

Every script is licensed under the MIT License.
