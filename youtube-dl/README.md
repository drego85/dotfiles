# youtube-dl

[`youtube-dl`][1] is a program that can be used to download videos and audios
from a [very large list][2] of websites, such as YouTube. I use it frequently to
download music.

On Fedora youtube-dl is correclty packaged and frequently updated. So there are
no problems. Run the installer script or do manually:

    sudo dnf install youtube-dl
